# Purpose
A SMS app sometimes needs structured user input. Canadian Tire roadside assistance used this approach last time I needed it. 
# Tasks to be performed:
In this case you need to send links to a web page form in the SMS message and capture the structured input in the same app that implements the SMS web hook. 

You will add delivery to your SMS bot by collecting payment from the Paypal sandbox through a form you will link to in SMS.

Extend the order bot from assignment 
1. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). 
2. The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. 
3. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.
